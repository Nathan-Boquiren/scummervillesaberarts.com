      "value": "Juyo, also known as Vaapad when modified by Mace Windu, is the most aggressive and unpredictable form of lightsaber combat. It focuses on overwhelming opponents with fast, powerful strikes and relentless pressure. Juyo practitioners tap into their emotions to fuel their attacks, which can lead to a dangerous path toward the dark side if not controlled. Mace Windu’s unique adaptation, Vaapad, channels the user’s darkness into a combat style that turns the opponent’s aggression against them. This form requires great discipline and self-awareness, making it a high-risk, high-reward choice for advanced users."
