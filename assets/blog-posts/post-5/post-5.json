This same focus can be applied to everyday life. Whether you’re studying for a test or working on a project, having a clear mind is essential for success."

      "value": "In lightsaber training, even a brief lapse in focus can lead to mistakes. Similarly, when we lose concentration in real life, we’re more prone to errors. Developing mental discipline—whether through meditation, breathing exercises, or mindfulness—helps us stay centered and present."
