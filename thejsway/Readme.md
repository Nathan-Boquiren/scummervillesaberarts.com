# Holiday Homework

#### Welcome to your holiday homework package!

In the first week of January, we are going to start building fun interactive programs. Read the book TheJsWay, just the "introduction" and "Learn to code programs" chapters, and complete the assignments at the end of each chapter.

Use the files in this folder to help you organize and fill out your answers. The files are organized in chapters, so puzzles from chapter 1 are in "ch1.js", chapter 2 in "ch2.js", and so on. The exact text from the question is in the book, but most of the chapter files have the text from that challenge.

## Setup

1. Move this folder into your code folder so that "thejsway" folder is inside your class code folder
2. Using the terminal, move into that folder by typing `cd thejsway`
3. Install the necessary helpers with `npm i` - this will build a "node_modules" folder that you can ignore
4. Back out of your thejsway folder by typing `cd ..`
5. Test to see if it works with this: `node thejsway/test.js`

If it is successful, you will see some text, then a prompt will ask you to say something. Type anything and hit enter. If you get an error, please ask for help.

From now on, you can run each code file, for example, `node thejsway/ch1`.

I'm also providing you with some basic utils that are imported at the top of every file.

- `cl` - the familiar shortcut to "console.log" - just use `cl("anything");`
- `title` - it just prints titles to separate each section in your files
- `prompt` - replicates the web browser's prompt functionality to take in user input
