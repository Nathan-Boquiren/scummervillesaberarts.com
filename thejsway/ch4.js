  // Write a program that shows all numbers between 1 and 100 with the following exceptions:
  //   - It shows "Fizz" instead if the number is divisible by 3.
  //   - It shows "Buzz" instead if the number is divisible by 5 and not by 3.
  // When it's done, improve it so that the program shows "FizzBuzz" instead for numbers divisible both by 3 and by 5.
  // This exercise has many, many solutions. It's a job interview classic that a significant number of candidates fail. Try your best!
